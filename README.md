I ran the server with uvicorn and tested it with postman. Here are the results:

Headers:
Only 4 Header fields were set: date, server, content-length, and content type.
Date: self-explanatory, the date of the request.
Server: This was set to "uvicorn".
Content-length: Length of the response body, varies because of my implementation of random strings. Generally around 100.
Content-type: application/json

Body:
The body generally looked like this:

["Pd+88'S","_y,>","FIz",".f>S8","Z>.X\u000bjO","f(8%{+h","!&6}X`","F~\"H:qRCn8","fXo",";{H3s(L`v)","JUg9^}","g7=\t6a\"","\u000b6UI~","9#W","NNw6f@y\fpx",".P8C\r9<<","gr&sX:","^\\mpK1{*O","/gX-AJ","MHVsSwKTj"]

it consists of 5-20 strings of length 3-10.
